Miscellaneous programs for working with Pushbullet  
pushy_test.py need pushybullet to work, but I'll try to write my own bindings when I'll be better at Python. For now, it's written in python2, receive instructions from socket and send data through serial. So it's not a general purpose program, but it will soon be ;)
